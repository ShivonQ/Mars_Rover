# Mars_Rover
Basic Mars Rover Photo Explorer

in order to get this running you need a NASA API Key, which can be obtained here:
https://api.nasa.gov/index.html#apply-for-an-api-key

Then create a file in the root called api_key.py
''This is a temporary solution, next editionw ill have env-var instead''

Then you run from command like any other Flask App, by navigating to the root directory, and typing:
''python app.py''

The server should now be running on ''http://127.0.0.1:5000/''
